# live-stream-downloader
Download M3U8 live streams to the local disk. This is a fork of the original [live-stream-downloader](https://webextension.org/listing/hls-downloader.html) extension.

#### What this fork changes
- Removed blocklist, download videos and streams from any website!
- Removed code related to blocking, lighter extension!
- Single SVG file for extension icon, even more lighter!

Note : Even though Youtube was removed from the blocklist, the add-on still can't download videos from Youtube, because Youtube uses DASH streaming, which is not supported by this add-on.
